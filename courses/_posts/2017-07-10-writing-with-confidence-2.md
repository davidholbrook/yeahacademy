### Class Description:
***Instructor's Note:**  If your student took Level 1 last year and the instructor recommended progressing to Level 2, your student should take this course this year, which continues with the second level of last year's curriculum. Levels 1 and 2 must be taken in consecutive years.*
Writing with Confidence uses the award-winning and proven approach of the Institute for Excellence in Writing. Students gain mastery of the basic skills of writing through weekly lessons in structure and style. By practicing note-taking, writing from outlines, creative writing, essays, research reports, critiques, and other types of writing, students internalize the standard structure of such compositions so that it becomes second nature to them. In addition, they learn stylistic techniques and keep using them as the year progresses. Powerful word choices, sentence variation, and figurative language become easier for them, making their writing come alive. Since each lesson has a clear checklist of required elements of structure and style, students know exactly what they need to do to succeed on an assignment. As students gradually move toward independence with their writing skills, their confidence grows and their creativity blossoms.
This course is literature-based; students read the fourth through seventh books in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series. Generally one to three chapters per week are assigned; novels may be read by the family for read-aloud time or by the student. Topics are the same as in Level 1, but material and assignments are more challenging. Topics include outlining, summarizing, writing from outlines, narratives, topic sentences, research reports, stories, creative writing, essays, response to literature, editing, revising, grammar, stylistic techniques, and vocabulary enrichment. Students participate in games and contests, present oral reports, and prepare a final portfolio.
