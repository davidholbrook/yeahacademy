### Class Description:
Good story telling teaches-whether heard, read or seen. Movies often have resounding messages just as literature does; themes of right and wrong, ethics, moral dilemmas, coming of age, plot development and irony are just a few of their common traits. In this course, students will learn to critique narrative content and form, identify underlying messages, and analyze a wide range of films in multiple genres and compare them to their source material.

**Classroom time:** Time with tutor in the classroom will be spent discussing, critiquing, reviewing and analyzing the movies that students have watched at home in preparation for class.  Applicable film snippets will be viewed in class, as needed, to illustrate a point for discussion, but the actual movie will be watched in its entirety by the student at home with their family.  Students will need access to rental movie sources

### Texts
A range of films and texts will be used. Supplemental readings will be provided by tutor. Films and novels that may either be purchased, rented or checked out from the library.
