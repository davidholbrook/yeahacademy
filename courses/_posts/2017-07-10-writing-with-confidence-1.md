### Class Description:
This course is literature-based; students read the first three books in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series. Generally one to three chapters per week are assigned; novels may be read by the family for read-aloud time or by the student. Topics include outlining, summarizing, writing from outlines, narratives, topic sentences, research reports, stories, creative writing, essays, response to literature, editing, revising, grammar, stylistic techniques, and vocabulary enrichment. Students participate in games and contests, present oral reports, and prepare a final portfolio.
