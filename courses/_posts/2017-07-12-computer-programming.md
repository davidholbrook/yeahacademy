### Class Description:
In this course, students will learn how to think critically and problem-solve as they build their own computer programs, games, and websites. Students can bring the programming skills taught in this course into the workplace, where an increasing number of jobs require some computer programming literacy. This course will give students the tools they need to begin coding in any language, introducing them to programming concepts like iteration, conditionals, variables, arrays, events, functions, and more!

In the first semester, students will learn general computer programming concepts using Scratch, a beginner programming language from MIT. They will build their own computer game, interactive story, or any computer program they can imagine.

In the second semester, students will make their own website or browser game using the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Their website can then be published on the internet to share, and can be used to launch their digital portfolio.

There will be a parent showcase at the end of each semester, to give students the opportunity to show off their projects for that semester.

**Students are required to bring a laptop to class, which they should be able to use during the week for homework assignments.**
