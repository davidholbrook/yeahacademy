### Class Description:
Post-WWII history, popular culture, and politics around the world. If you’d rather watch a film about an important moment in history than read about it in a textbook, then this is the class for you! Starting with the Cold War and concluding with the Internet Age, this two-semester course explores the tumultuous and exciting period of world history from 1945 to the 2010s. Unlike earlier periods of history, the 20th century can easily be experienced second-hand through film, audio recordings, and of course, living memory. So, through multi-media cultural investigation, documentary viewing, class discussions, and updates to a weekly blog, students taking World Civilizations will gain a well-rounded understanding of the key events of the last 70 years that built the world we live in today . . . without ever opening a textbook.

**Topical overview:** Fall semester covers the years of 1945 to 1970, and spring semester covers 1970 to the 2010s.

**Graded assignments:** This course is designed to provide an alternative to memorization-heavy history courses. Ideal for visual and social learners. Students write blog posts, answer questions about assigned videos, assemble timelines, and complete a final semester presentation.
