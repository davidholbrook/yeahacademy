### Class Description:
**NOTE:** Mythology & Folklore is not offered for 2017-18 but is returning in 2018-2019
Every culture has its own stories, whether in the form of myths, fables, or fairy tales. These tales reflect the worldview of that people group. Through the study of these stories, historians gain insight into the values, traditions, and history of that culture. In this class, we will examine stories from around the world and from various time periods, studying their literary elements and their respective historical context.  This course covers topics ranging from sociology and anthropology to philosophy, literary devices, and the nature of communication.

* Greek, Egyptian, Norse, and Hindu mythology
* Fairy tales from Japan, Russia, and Africa
