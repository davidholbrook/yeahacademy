### Class Description:
Students will develop critical thinking skills and research writing of informative and persuasive papers as they explore ethical issues.  MLA writing requirements will be incorporated as we outline, use in-text citation, and create the works cited page.  This language arts course teaches students to think and write under a Judeo-Christian worldview with application from a variety of mediums: literature, poetry, short stories, news, advertising, and other mass-mediated messages from daily life.  The coursework focuses on reading, writing, and critical thinking activities, as well as application and creative presentation of ideas.  Grammar and mechanics will be taught within the context of writing according to class needs.
