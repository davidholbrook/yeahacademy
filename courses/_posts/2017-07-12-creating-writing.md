### Class Description:
There’s no better way to learn grammar, mechanics, and style than by practicing writing. And there’s no better way to get kids writing than to encourage them to record the funny, fascinating, and sometimes fractured stories that are already inside their brains AND to give them an audience! This course is designed to help middle school students become better writers by taking advantage of the natural storyteller inside each student. Students will write and share with their classmates a variety of creative forms including sketches, stories, and poems—culminating in the spring with a professionally printed and bound hardcover book that they have written and illustrated themselves. We cover all the how-to basics—grammar and mechanics, sentence structure, and stylistic techniques—as students develop their own writing style and voice.
This course is taught by Professor Hope, an adjunct English professor for North Central University, who has also taught the Institute for Excellence in Writing curriculum to middle school and high school students for many years. Although the focus of this class is on creative writing, parents can be assured their students will learn techniques that will improve their students’ scholarly writing as well, making them better equipped for their future academic endeavors.
