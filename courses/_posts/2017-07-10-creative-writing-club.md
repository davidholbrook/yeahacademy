### Class Description:
This class provides the opportunity for students of all writing abilities to write, share ideas, and collaborate with other students. The goals of this course are to encourage the exploration of different genres of writing, promote curiosity, develop a passion for writing, and provide a place for creative collaboration. To help meet this goal student will participate in writing exercises and prompts, experiment with new ideas through free writing, share work out-loud, as well as offer comments/suggestions in group and individual settings. Students will be expected to write creative pieces weekly, either short pieces or sections of a larger work, to share for peer review or to read out-loud. Work by students may be fiction, non-fiction, or poetry.The central tenet of this class are the ideas that:*	"We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master."  ― Ernest Hemingway*	"To look at the work of your peers, and learn how to explain with kindness and precision, the nature of their mistakes is, in fact, how you learn to diagnose your own work." ― Steve Almond 
*	"It is no sign of weakness or defeat that your manuscript ends up in need of major surgery. This is common in all writing and among the best of writers." ― E.B. White
