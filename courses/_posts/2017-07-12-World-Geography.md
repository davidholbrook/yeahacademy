### Class Description:
A criminal mastermind has escaped the clutches of Scotland Yard! Of course, only the most dedicated international security team will be able to trek through dusty bazaars and remote islands and clean up the wake of catastrophes and destruction he leaves behind. Over the course of two semesters, each student has the chance to prevent GLOBAL DISASTERS (and maybe even cause a few) through competition and team strategizing. Weekly class time includes geography games, debate, trivia competitions, current news discussion, individual geography projects, etc. This course is designed for beginner and intermediate geography students: providing the foundational social studies concepts needed to analyze global events and topics and to continue to develop a 3-D mental map of global regions and relationships.

**Topical overview:** Fall semester covers Europe, Russia, North America, Middle America and the Caribbean, South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Spring semester covers North Africa and Southwest Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and Australasia.

**Graded assignments:** This media-rich course is perfect for students who prefer a social and hands-on learning environment and minimal assigned reading. Students view news reports and documentaries, answer questions about assigned videos, find news items to share in class, complete map quizzes, and present a final semester project.
