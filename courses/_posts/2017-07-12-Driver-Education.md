### Class Description:
TEENS INC. Driving School provides a unique, proven approach to the education of teen drivers. In addition to classroom teaching, life-saving, hands-on techniques included in field trips provide on-site learning experiences. Salvage yards reconstruct car crashes to show students the value of defensive driving. Trauma center visits introduce students to post-accident real-life. Golf Carts help students learn the techniques of driving in a controlled situation. Teens Inc. is the ONLY driving school that can offer its graduates (who carry Allstate Insurance Only) up to a 30% discount on their insurance rates!

2 out-of-class Field Trips @ $10.00 per day are due on the day of trip (or $15.00 for both paid on the 1st trip) – cash or check to Teens Inc. must be paid on or by the 1st day of trips.
