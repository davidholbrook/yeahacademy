### Class Description:
In this course, students will learn how to think critically and problem-solve as they build their own simple computer programs, games, and websites. This course will introduce students to the basic programming concepts they will need to begin coding in any language.

In the first semester, students will become comfortable with general computer programming concepts using Scratch, a beginner programming language from MIT. They will build their own computer game, interactive story, or any computer program they can imagine.

In the second semester, students will learn how to make their own website or browser game using the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Their website can then be published on the internet to share with friends, family, and whoever they want.

There will be a parent showcase at the end of each semester, to give students the opportunity to show off their projects for that semester.

**Students are required to bring a laptop to class, which they should be able to use during the week for homework assignments.**
