### Class Description:
In this exciting advanced biology course we will cover the anatomy and physiology of the 11 major body systems in detail.  Class time will include a mix of lecture, discussion, dissection and practical hands-on lab activities.  We will also invite guest speakers to discuss careers in medicine, bio-science, business and biotechnology.  While this is a great course for all students interested in medicine, bio-sciences, or medical business, all students can benefit from developing a working knowledge of the human body.
