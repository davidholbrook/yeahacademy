Mid-year entry available for spring if space is availableSTEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. Rather than teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world examples.### Class Description:This course will explore the divine design of the physical world around us. The course will use only simple math and focus on the laws and principle of physics and how they are used in the real world.Topics included are; linear motion, rotary motion, projectiles, Newton's laws, momentum, energy, rotational mechanics, universal gravitation, temperature & heat, thermodynamics, refraction & reflection, light & sound, vibrations & waves, electricity, and magnetism.We will explore how these topics apply to real life, in sports, the kitchen, home, and work place. The students will simulate the engineering workplace by working on projects as a team. (example: design a better wheel chair, hit a golf ball farther, or a better jar opener).Time in the classroom will be a mix of lecture, discussion and lab experiences.Assignments will include weekly homework, completion of papers, presentations, quizzes, and tests.** Required:** Internet access is important as a number of assignments will require internet connection.### TextsAll course materials and some lab supplies provided by instructor. Students must bring a 2" 3 ring binder. Free Etextbooks and youtube videos will be used.### Total Due* $200.00 per semester* All course lab materials provided by tutor for in class use. * See above list for text and materials to be provided by student. * Payment due with Registration per semester – paid in full per semester at the time of registration.### Payable toBruce Whitney
