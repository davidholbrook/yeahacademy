### Class Description:
This year-long class covers the very beginnings of our country up through WWII.  The study of United States History is the story of our ancestors and how they shaped a nation. We will explore this story through the eyes of the people who lived it using living books, biographies, field trips, speakers, hands-on activities, and first-hand accounts. The goal of this class is to bring American History to life for the students.
The Civics component is built into the class and is not treated as a separate subject.

This is a very projects-based class with some tests and quizzes. There will be 1-3 hours of homework given each week. There also may be costs throughout the year for field trips that will not be mandatory.

**Required:** Internet access
