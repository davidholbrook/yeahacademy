### Class Description:
In this course, students will learn how to think critically and problem-solve as they build their own computer games and programs. Students can bring the programming skills taught in this course into the workplace, where an increasing number of jobs require some computer programming literacy. This course will give students the tools they need to begin working with any programming language, including basic problem solving strategies and programming techniques like iteration, conditionals, variables, arrays, events, and functions!
Students will learn general computer programming concepts and strategies using Scratch, a beginner programming language from MIT. They will build their own computer games, interactive stories, and any other computer programs they can imagine.

There will be a showcase at the end of each semester, to give students the opportunity to show off their hard work for that semester.

**Students are required to bring a laptop to class, which they should be able to use during the week for homework assignments.**
