### Class Description:
American History is a survey course that provides students with an investigation of important political, economic, religious and social developments in American history from the pre-colonial time period to the Present Time. Students will be engaged in activities that call upon their skills as historians (i.e. recognizing cause and effect relationships), various forms of research, expository and persuasive writing, and reading of primary and secondary sources, comparing and contrasting important ideas and events.

 Students will also be assigned book report during the year (one each semester) which will be the basis of their presentation in class. Titles of the novels and of the timeline of the unit of study will be announced later. Students will develop a deepened understanding of the following processes and skills: reading and communication; inquiry, research, and analysis; public discourse and decision making; and citizen involvement, as they build the general social studies knowledge that will form the foundation for high school social studies instruction.
