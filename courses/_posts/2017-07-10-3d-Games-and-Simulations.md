### Class Description:
This course will build on skills students learned in the previous course, expanding on their programming knowledge by giving them experience and training in professional programming tools and languages.Students will learn to use professional programming language C# and 3D game engine Unity3D. They will discover how to manipulate objects in 3D space, program using class methods and variables, and manage assets and code together in a professional programming environment. By the end of the year, students will be able to build simple 2D or 3D programs that will run on almost any platform!There will be a showcase at the end of each semester, to give students the opportunity to show off their hard work for that semester.Students are required to bring a laptop and charger to class, which they should be able to use during the week to complete homework assignments.
