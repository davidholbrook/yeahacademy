### Class Description:
Improv! will push students to think faster, make stronger choices, and trust their instincts without the fear and anxiety of planning. Students will learn the basic improvisation concept of “Yes, and..” plus discover how a scene can be created through agreement. As the session progresses students will begin to learn elements of structure for performance and create fully improvised scenes with more than two performers. (Work will be done in short and long form.) This is a fun and absolutely necessary class for the beginning or seasoned actor.
