### Class Description:
In this course, students will read and discuss important works of literature, philosophy, and history. Modeled after the Great Books Program at St. John's College, the discussions in this course will develop students’ logical and rhetorical skills and encourage them to think more deeply about the world. Students will learn to read difficult texts carefully, think through challenging questions on their own and as a group, and express themselves through critical discussion together regardless of differing opinions, perspectives, and beliefs. Students in The Great Books Discussion Course: The Ancients will read important works from the ancient world that laid the foundations of western philosophy and raised questions that still inspire discussion thousands of years later.Assignments each week will be appropriate for a high school reading level.
