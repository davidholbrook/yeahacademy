Fall Semester: Ancient through Medieval ArtSpring Semester: Renaissance through Modern
### Class Description:A survey of the history of the world through art with "gallery walks", discussion and Studio Studies – art projects to complement and enhance various areas and eras studied. The instructor-designed, colorful text, including hands-on colored "art cards" (a collection of photos of masterpieces of art) will be used for home study and review. Students will examine who some of the great artists were, what work they produced, when and where various historical periods of great art originated, why specific artwork has stood the test of time, and how we can determine what is "good" art.Two different but continuous courses are offered, one each semester, both using the timeline approach.Field  trips are offered per semester to the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia).  They coordinate with the periods being studied in class as the students "time travel" through history through art. There is no charge for museum entrance.  A reflection paper is due each semester based on these Mia visits.
