Students should have completed geometry and have taken or concurrently taking Algebra II or an equivalent course. Although the Physics 1 course includes basic use of trigonometric functions, this understanding can be gained either in the concurrent math course or in the AP Physics 1 course itself.

### Class Description:

Students explore principles of Newtonian mechanics (including rotational motion) ; work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits. The course is based on six Big Ideas, which encompass core scientific principles, theories, and processes that cut across traditional boundaries and provide a broad way of thinking about the physical world.

The following are Big Ideas: 

* Objects and systems have properties such as mass and charge. Systems may have internal structure.* Fields existing in space can be used to explain interactions. The interactions of an object with other objects can be described by forces.* Interactions between systems can result in changes in those systems. Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws.* Waves can transfer energy and momentum from one location to another without the permanent transfer of mass and serve as a mathematical model for the description of other phenomena.

### Texts
Apologia - Exploring Creation With Physics 2nd edition, free etexts & youtube videos. Students should have a three ring binder for lab notes.

### Total Due
$210.00 per semester provides:
* College level instruction by an AP approved instructor* The option of AP designation on their high school transcript* Possibility of earning college credit if their AP exam score is high enough.
