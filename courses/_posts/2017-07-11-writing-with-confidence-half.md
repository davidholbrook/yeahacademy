### Class Description:
**New Content This Year**  If your student took Level Half last year and the instructor recommended repeating Level Half, your student should take this course, which contains new content at the same level for additional practice with IEW skills.
Writing with Confidence uses the award-winning and proven approach of the Institute for Excellence in Writing. Students gain mastery of the basic skills of writing through weekly lessons in structure and style. By practicing note-taking, writing from outlines, creative writing, essays, research reports, critiques, and other types of writing, students internalize the standard structure of such compositions so that it becomes second nature to them. In addition, they learn stylistic techniques and keep using them as the year progresses. Powerful word choices, sentence variation, and figurative language become easier for them, making their writing come alive. Since each lesson has a clear checklist of required elements of structure and style, students know exactly what they need to do to succeed on an assignment. As students gradually move toward independence with their writing skills, their confidence grows and their creativity blossoms.

This class teaches the basics of outlining, summarizing, writing from outlines, stories, topic sentences, research reports, creative writing, editing, revising, grammar, and stylistic techniques. It incorporates vocabulary enrichment, class games and contests, oral presentation, and a final portfolio. This class moves at about half the pace of Level 1 and is ideal for beginning writers.
