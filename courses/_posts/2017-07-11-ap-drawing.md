Light and shade, line quality, rendering of form, composition, surface manipulation, and illusion of depth are drawing issues that can be addressed through a variety of means, which could include painting, printmaking, mixed media, etc.  Abstract observational works may demonstrate drawing competence.  The range of marks used to make drawings, the arrangement of those marks, and thee materials used to make the marks are endless.

The portfolio will include 5 original works of art that  demonstrate the mastery of drawing in concept, composition and execution. Each piece will have with detailed description  and dimensions.

All students must be invited and approved by the instructor.
