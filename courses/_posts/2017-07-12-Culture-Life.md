### Class Description:
This Social Studies l course is a uniquely designed unit study using two great texts that will be useful as references for years to come.   An Artful Journey Through 5000 Years of History and Etiquette Intermediate will be used as we study the elements of culture and learn how and what civilizations have contributed to the Western World.  This course gives your student a worldview primer, using weekly vocabulary to understand history, religions, geography,  economy, world rulers, governments, communication, and more.  We learn how etiquette and social skills are the foundation of any successful society. 

The study of culture, etiquette and history will take place through a variety of projects as well: calligraphy/copy work, role play/public speaking, illuminated manuscripts/art, heraldry, and reading/reporting.  To assist the student in examining the roles of rulers and their reasoning, students will use a the 5000 Year History as a  historical time line.  During this course, the student will travel through time meeting important people by learning the history of the calendar as it is interwoven through this course.  This course is adapted to all types of learning styles. Students will learn and discuss over 120 etiquette skills during the course of two semesters.
