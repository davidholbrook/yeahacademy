### Class Description:
Second-year students deepen their skills and delve more thoroughly into character development and scene analysis, with emphasis on creating acting objectives and discovering scenes through character relationships. Students will investigate the physical and inner-workings of a character by participating in a more advanced set of improvisational exercises and age appropriate scenes and/or monologues selected from literature. Each session will culminate in a showcase performed for parents and friends on the last day of class.
