### Class Description:
This Scene Study integrates the thoughtful examination of a play in its depth of idea and how its meaning translates into an actor’s behavior. Students will learn how to make intelligent choices that serve the play. This course is designed for the actor who has a basic technique, but is seeking a stronger foundation. Actors will analyze the text, the specific creation of a character, and the ability to act on impulse with imagination and heart. We will read several plays, work on scene cuttings and work to understand the behaviors of the characters through some specialized improvisation techniques.
