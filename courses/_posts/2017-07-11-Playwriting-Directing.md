### Class Description:
**Playwriting Lab:** Through in-class writing exercises, at-home writing assignments, class discussions, and in-class readings of participants’ work, writers will learn the essentials of good playwriting, including character motivation, plot structure, dialogue, dramatic conflict, as well as proper formatting. Writers will spend the last several weeks writing a 10 Minute Play All written work will be shared with the class in a supportive and challenging environment. Some pieces will be chosen to perform at The Night of the Arts.

**Directing Lab:** Students interested in directing plays will learn the basic elements of directing (composition, picturization, pantomimic dramatization, movement, rhythm, tempo) by following and actively participating in a step-by-step process with the class.  Each concept is learned progressively and the approach is completely experiential allowing his/her own personal directing style to emerge. Directing students will get hands-on directing experience working with students from the Level I class (meeting at the same time).
