### Class Description:
This high school writing and literature course is perfect for both reluctant and enthusiastic writers and readers. An excellent choice for high school students who aren't enrolled in PSEO English, it exposes them to concepts that every educated person should know—in fun and engaging ways. Students will learn about and experience literary and historical movements and philosophies including Greek tragedy, Shakespearean comedy, epic poetry, Romanticism, Transcendentalism, the Harlem Renaissance, the Gothic, humor, feminism, psychoanalytic theory, aestheticism, and utopianism/dystopianism.  The class uses interactive small group activities and interdisciplinary topics to get students thinking about literature and life in new and intriguing ways. A wide variety of composition assignments, from creative to scholarly and everything in between, helps students practice and develop their thinking and writing skills. Reading selections and writing assignments range from simple to challenging.
