### Class Description:
Have you ever torn your hair out trying to get your students to practice writing papers? Well, one way to help combat this is to make writing fun. And what better way to do that then to have them participate in writing a newspaper?During this course, students will help design, edit, and write a monthly newspaper for YEAH. As the year progresses, each student will be required to write at least once for each section of the paper, gaining experience in various forms of writing. Grammar rules will be discussed along with ethics in journalism, interviewing techniques, and other journalistic topic. Students will also get practice in meeting deadlines and editing. One parent had this to say after their student attended this course:"My daughter is now at a very challenging school and received an A in English/writing, and I attribute a lot of this to her work with Sue. She learned to organize her thoughts through outlines, to write, to rewrite, to express and communicate herself clearly through writing. The proof is in the results."This is a 75-minute course. It can be used on a high school report card as an elective (Journalism) or as a writing course.
