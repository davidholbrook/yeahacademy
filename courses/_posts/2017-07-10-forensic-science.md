### Class Description:
  You've been engaged by "CSI" and have been fascinated by "NCIS," but how accurately do these shows portray the realities of forensic science? The field of forensic science comprises several areas of study (anatomy, chemistry, biology, physics, etc.). This hands-on course integrates these sciences in the pursuit of justice. Students will focus on the criminal investigation process that will include crime scene investigation, evidence gathering procedures and subsequent laboratory analysis of evidence.

This is a lab course and the students will be doing laboratory work
almost every class. There will be about 1 hour of homework per week.
