Jennie Lodien is a graduate of St. Cloud State, Minnesota, with a B.S. in Business and minor in Graphic Design. Mrs. Lodien brings both a love of learning and an amazement over Creation to her classroom where both book work and hands-on experiments will help convey concepts about our physical earth. She won high marks as a science substitute at the YEAH Academy in 2009 and returned to teach the Apologia Physical Science course in 2011. She has taught and co-taught a variety of courses including Apologia General Science, Physicalâ€ˆScience and Chemistry, Intro to Logic, General Art, Survey of Literature Genres, Latin, Typography and Page Layout, and Algebra.

In 1992, after a 4-year run working in the art department at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, she set up shop and has freelanced from home in print design and production ever since. Her work includes the self-published I Am Chosen life book for adopted children which has sold over 3,000 copies ([www.IamChosenOnline.com](www.IamChosenOnline.com)). Along with home educating their three children since 1998, Mrs. Lodien has served in both teaching and administrative positions at the Heritage Home School Academy, Grace Fellowship, and various home groups.
