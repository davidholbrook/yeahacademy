Mr. Greg Membrez holds a B.A. in Classical Greek and music from the University of MN and an M.A. in Classical Greek and Latin. He has been a teaching assistant in Greek, Latin and Biblical studies including History of the Old Testament, History of Greek Religion and Medical Terminology. He has extensive study in the literature of the New Testament and early Christian literature in both Greek and Coptic. Mr. Membrez has recently been researching metaphor in ancient Greek and has presented his research at two major European conferences, in 2015 at the International Cognitive Linguistics Conference in Newcastle, England, and in 2016 at the Aristotle 2400 Years conference in Thessaloniki, Greece. He is now completing a finale draft of a paper on Aristotleâ€™s theory of metaphor which will be published the fall of 2017 in a volume entitled The Embodied Basis of Constructions in Greek and Latin published by John Benjamins.Believing in the quality education that is offered outside of the public school system, he has taught many home educated students over the years and is well acquainted with it through his brother and sister, homeschooling parents. He has tutored at The Academy since 2001. He created the Latin program for North Central University where he was also an adjunct professor in Latin and Greek from 2009 to 2015, and is presently an adjunct professor in Latin for Concordia University, St. Paul. Mr. Membrez also teaches private instrumental music lessons independently at YEAH during the fall and spring semesters.
