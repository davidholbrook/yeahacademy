Susan Kilbride graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in biology, Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation, she worked as a research assistant in Venezuela studying floodplain fish for two winters. Her first love was science and nature but as time went on she also discovered a passion for genealogy and history. She’s been a home educator since 2000 and has taught science, writing, and history classes to home educators both in Hawaii and Minnesota. She’s the author of Science Unit Studies for Homeschoolers and Teachers and a series of historical chapter books on American history, the Our America series. She and her students in Hawaii wrote a book on Hawaiian culture, The Hawai’iana Project that has been put in the Honolulu Public Library’s legacy library, where it is guaranteed to stay on the shelves for 100 years. Susan is also the author of a number of articles in various genealogical publications and was co-author of an article in Biotropica, a science journal. Susan’s goal is to make learning fun for her students so that they have a lifelong appreciation of whatever subject she teaches. She has tutored at The Academy since 2016.
